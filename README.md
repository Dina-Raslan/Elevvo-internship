# Elevevo Internship Projects

This repository contains all the tasks completed during the Machine Learning internship at Elevevo.  
All notebooks were developed on Google Colab and uploaded here as standard Jupyter notebooks.

- **Techniques**: Linear Regression + Polynomial Features, One-Hot Encoding, R² and MSE evaluation
- **Dataset**: Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)

### Task 2 – Customer Segmentation
- **File**: [**`Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`**](Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)
- **Description**: Unsupervised clustering of mall customers based on annual income and spending score.
